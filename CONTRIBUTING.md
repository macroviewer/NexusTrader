# Contributing to TradeBotPro

We greatly appreciate contributions from the community, as they help us improve TradeBotPro and make it more robust for
everyone!

## Steps

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss your proposed changes or enhancements.

2. Once the proposal is aligned with the project's goals, fork the main branch and ensure your fork is kept up-to-date
   by regularly syncing with upstream changes.

3. Install and configure pre-commit on your local machine to automatically handle code checks, formatters, and linters
   before committing.
   Install pre-commit with:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit  
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. Open a pull request (PR) targeting the main branch. Include a clear summary in the PR description and reference any
   relevant GitHub issue(s).

5. Once submitted, your PR will be reviewed promptly by the team. We’ll provide feedback or suggestions if changes are
   necessary before merging.

## Tips
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and self-contained to facilitate easier review.
- Reference related GitHub issue(s) directly in the PR comment for clarity and traceability.

Thank you for your contributions! Together, we can make TradeBotPro even better.
